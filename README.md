# Job Sphere 

Job Sphere is a modern, full-stack job application platform designed to connect job seekers with employers seamlessly. The platform provides robust functionalities for browsing job listings, applying for jobs dynamically, and a complete user authentication system to secure the application process.

##  Project Overview

The project is divided into two main folders:
- **Frontend**: A highly responsive, modern UI built for job seekers.
- **Backend**: A secure, scalable RESTful API handling business logic and data persistence.

##  Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) structured with modern web technologies, focusing on delivering a fast, interactive, and beautiful user experience. 

### Tech Stack:
- **React 19 & Vite**: For lightning-fast development and optimized production builds.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: For utility-first, fully responsive styling.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth, dynamic page transitions and interactive micro-animations.
- **Formik & Yup**: For efficient form state management and schema-based validation (used in login, registration, and application forms).
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Lucide React**: For elegant and consistent iconography.

### Key Features:
- **Job Discovery**: Search, filter, and view detailed job postings.
- **Dynamic Apply**: Users can apply for jobs securely from the Job Details page.
- **User Authentication UI**: Includes interactive Login and Registration pages that communicate with the backend.
- **Form Validation**: Immediate feedback on form inputs to ensure data integrity before submission.

##  Backend Architecture

The backend serves as the foundation of Job Sphere, built to securely process requests, manage authentication, and handle database operations.

### Tech Stack:
- **Node.js & Express.js**: For creating a lightweight, fast, and robust RESTful API.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: A NoSQL database for flexible data storage, using Mongoose for object modeling.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for stateless, secure user authentication and authorization. Only logged-in users can apply for jobs or view specific sensitive endpoints.
- **Bcrypt.js**: For securely hashing and salting user passwords.
- **CORS & Dotenv**: For secure cross-origin requests and environment variable management.

### Key Features:
- **User Management**: API endpoints for registering users, authenticating logins, and issuing JWTs.
- **Job Endpoints**: RESTful routes to fetch job listings, retrieve job details, and manage job applications.
- **Security Check**: Middleware to ensure that only authenticated (logged-in) users can submit job applications. User IDs are automatically tied to their applications.
- **Database Seeding**: Included scripts to quickly populate the MongoDB database with initial sample job data.

##  How to Run the Project Locally

To run Job Sphere on your local machine, you will need to start both the Frontend and Backend servers.

### 1. Starting the Backend
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables (e.g., `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`) in a `.env` file within the `backend` folder.
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 2. Starting the Frontend
1. Open a new, separate terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

##  Conclusion
Job Sphere demonstrates excellent full-stack engineering practices, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between the client and the server, secure data handling, and an engaging, beautiful user interface.
